The 9/11 terrorist attacks had a major impact on Battery Park\n City. The residents of lower Manhattan and particularly of Battery Park\n City were displaced for ten days. Upon return, the air in the area was still filled with toxic smoke from \nthe World Trade Center fires that persisted until January 2002. The neighborhood, which is the site of the World Financial Center (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Financial_Center) along with numerous housing, commercial and retail buildings, is named for adjacent Battery Park (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_Park_%28New_York%29)"

Since the late 1990s, many upper-class young professionals in their twenties and thirties have begun to move into the area. On weekends, there is often a raucous restaurant-and-bar scene along Third Avenue. South of Murray Hill, blocks on Lexington Avenue (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington_Avenue_%28Manhattan%29) around 28th Street are sometimes informally called “Curry Hill,” due to the current high concentration of Indian restaurants (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_cuisine) and specialized grocery stores."

Its gritty reputation kept real estate prices below those of \nmost other areas of Manhattan until the early 1990s. Since then, rent \nprices have increased enormously, and many famous entertainers have resided here, including Burt Reynolds (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Reynolds), Bob Hope (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hope), James Dean (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dean), and Jerry Seinfeld (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Seinfeld).

Sutton Place encompasses two public parks overlooking the East River, which have undergone much controversy given the close proximity to FDR Drive, a major expressway along Manhattan&#39;s eastern edge. One of these parks is, in fact, cantilevered over the expressway. Sutton Place is present in much popular culture, being the famous Dead End (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_End) of the 1935 play and 1937 movie of that name, and mentioned in the novel Catcher in the Rye (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher_in_the_Rye) as the location of a &quot;swanky&quot; apartment.

The Upper East Side maintains one of the highest pricing per square foot in the United States. A 2002 report cited the average cost per square foot as $856; however, that price has noticed a substantial jump, increasing to almost as much as $1,200 per square foot as of 2006. The area is host to some of the most famous museums in the world. The string of museums along Fifth Avenue fronting Central Park has been dubbed &quot;Museum Mile (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_Mile,_New_York).&quot; It was once named &quot;Millionaire&#39;s Row.&quot;"

Situated near the famous Bloomingdale Road, its hotels, houses of \nentertainment and post office made it an alluring destination of \nsuburban retreat from the city.

The neighborhood is now the site of a major planned expansion of Columbia University (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University), which has campuses in Morningside Heights to the south and Washington Heights (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Heights,_Manhattan) to the north."

Most of the housing here dates from the extension of the elevated and subway \nlines at the end of the 19th and the start of the 20th Century. The brownstone revival of the 1960s and 1970s led to a new movement of \nmiddle-class blacks in the area. Latinos arrived in large numbers in the\n 1980s, with Dominicans making up the majority. Today the local population is changing again, with Hispanics (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic) constituting a majority of the population. Many actors, artists, teachers, and other professionals now reside in Hamilton Heights. Hamilton Heights is the home of City College of New York (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_College_of_New_York) (CCNY), Dance Theatre of Harlem (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Theatre_of_Harlem), The Harlem School of"

This played a critical role during the Battle of Fort Washington (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Washington), which occurred on November 16, 1776, when the fort fell to the British at great cost to American forces. Over the years, the area has been home to Irish immigrants, European Jews escaping Nazism, and later many Greeks.

Because of its water boundary on three sides, the hilly geography, and \nthe limited local street connections, the neighborhood can\n feel somewhat physically detached from the rest of the borough. Inwood is very large in area for a Manhattan neighborhood, and its real \nestate is sharply bifurcated between east and west. The districts east of Broadway are of lower-income and \nSpanish-speaking. This area is also more industrial and commercial and has few parks and trees. Inwood Hill Park (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inwood_Hill_Park), on the Hudson River, is known for its caves (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave) that were used by the Lenape (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenape) before Europeans arrived, and the last salt"

The development of Lincoln Center, and more recently Trump Place (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Place) and other upscale high-rise apartment buildings have brought a measure of gentrification (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentrification) to the western end of Lincoln Square. Tourist information, sidewalk trash removal, and security patrol services are provided by the Lincoln Square BID (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Improvement_District). The famed Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Center_for_the_Performing_Arts) is located here. The reason for naming the area &quot;Lincoln Square&quot; is unknown."

Its renaming in July 1918, as a result of anti-German sentiment during World War I, gave impetus to the name &quot;Lenox Hill&quot; for the area, doubtless on the analogy of fashionable Murray Hill (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Hill,_Manhattan), though the hospital itself, a city block bounded on the north and south by 77th and 76th streets, and on the west and east by Park and Lexington Avenues, does not stand on former Lenox property."

The neighborhood is distinguished by streets that are &quot;off the grid&quot; — set at an angle to the other streets in Manhattan — sometimes confusing both tourists and city residents alike. These roads were laid out in an 18th century  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loft)grid plan (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_plan), approximately parallel or perpendicular to the Hudson, long before the Commissioners&#39; Plan of 1811 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioners%27_Plan_of_1811) which created the main street grid plan for later parts of the city."

The area eventually developed into a shanty Irish community, and later a high rate of violent crime and a haven for waterfront thieves. Today it is considered to be quite safe.

                "description": "The area is one of the primary centers of the global diamond industry. It was created when dealers moved north from an earlier district near Canal Street (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal_Street_%28Manhattan%29) and the Bowery (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowery), and from the Financial District (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_District,_Manhattan). It grew in importance when the German Nazis (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazis) invaded the Netherlands (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands) and Belgium (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium), forcing thousands of Orthodox Jews (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Jews) in the diamond business to flee to New York City. An estimated 90% of diamonds in the United States enter through this area. Total receipts for the value of a single day&#39;s trade on the block average $400 million."

Because of its geography, Marble Hill is often associated with the Bronx; for instance, it is part of two of the Bronx&#39;s Community Board Districts.
